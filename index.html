                <h3 class="post-title">Brutis the Golden Retriever Snake Wrangler</h3>
                <p>Everyone has heard the expression “small but fierce.” Sometimes it is not the size something that makes it powerful, but rather the will inside. The story of five pound Chihuahua Zoey proves that courage cannot be gauged by size. As a three-foot rattlesnake approached a three-year-old child in Colorado in 2007, Zoey came to the rescue and received a bite above her own eye. Zoey survived the bite and the child was saved.

                <h3 class="post-title">Zoey the World’s Bravest Dog, Pound-for-pound</h3>
                <p>In their staunch devotion to their owners, dogs tend to be protective of their entire family, including children. When a coral snake slithered towards a young girl, Golden Retriever Brutis came to the rescue, snatching the snake and saving the girl’s life. In the process, Brutis was bitten himself; the seven-year-old hero was willing to risk his life to protect a small child. Luckily, he survived the bite and was promptly transported to Los Angeles to receive the National Hero Dog award, giving hope to families all over the world that even if they are not there to protect their children from dangers, perhaps dogs like Brutis are.

                </h3>
                <p>Many lives were lost due to the disastrous Hurricane Katrina, but there are also many inspiring stories of people who were saved. As the floodwaters began to rise, Katrina, a black Labrador, saved the life of a man who was drowning, and was ultimately recognized for her heroism at the Genesis Awards.

                <p>Wendy Rankin of Brackenridge, Pennsylvania has a dog named Hero. After Hero was injured in a traffic accident, Rankin had to make a choice of whether to put her down. The family decided to do what they could to save their dog, which gave Hero an opportunity to live up to her name a few months later. In February, Hero started barking at 3AM, which is very unusual for her. The family woke to find their home on fire! Everyone escaped, but the home was destroyed. The Rankin family credits their survival to Hero.

                <p>During her six-year career,  retired Marine Corps military working dog Luca led around 400 patrols in search of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and positively identified almost 40—saving innumerable lives. During her final act of service, Lucca was struct by one of those explosives, ultimately losing her leg but avoiding permanent hearing or vision loss. In 2016, she became the first U.S. military working dog to receive the Dickin Medal, which recognizes bravery or devotion to duty by service animals in the armed forces or civil defense.</p>

                  <p>Sergeant Stubby, a mixed breed dog with a stubby tail (possibly a Bull Terrier or Boston Terrier mix), started out as a stray who hung around a group of soldiers while they were training in New Haven, CT. He eventually became the most famous canine hero of WWI. He served in 17 battles in France alongside his best friend Private J. Robert Conroy and the 102nd Infantry, 26th Yankee Division. The fearless pup performed a number of vital roles, including alerting troops to incoming gas attacks, catching German spies, locating missing soldiers in between the trenches and boosting morale</p>

                  <p>A Belgian malinois Army dog named Layka lost a leg in 2012 after being shot four times with an AK-47 while clearing a Taliban compound in Afghanistan. The soldiers she served credited her actions with saving their lives. On their return home to America, one of them, Staff Sgt. Julian McDonald, adopted the three-legged dog of war.</p>

                          . The black Labrador was a member of the 104 Military Working Dog Support Unit and served in Afghanistan. There, the trained sniffer twice found hidden bombs in Helmand province in 2008. Treo was awarded the Dickin Medal, the highest military honor for an animal in Britain, in 2010. Sgt. Dave Heyhoe was the handler of Treo in the military, and the two served together in Northern Ireland before being shipped to Afghanistan. When both completed their military service, Treo went home to live with Heyhoe, who said Treo's action saved the lives of many soldiers.</p>

When his owner, a combat veteran who suffers from PTSD after being wounded in action, was overwhelmed with a seizure, the labrador/pitbull mix called 911 by stepping on his owner's iPhone. Thinking it was a prank or accidental call, dispatchers repeatedly hung up, which forced the service dog to call emergency services not once, but 10 times, as reported by the Huffington Post in 2014.</p>

                <p>Senior Airman David Sharpe was living with undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder and depression when he adopted a pit bull puppy from an animal shelter and named her Cheyenne. Months later, Sharpe was on the verge of suicide, sitting on the kitchen floor of his home with a handgun. Cheyenne came up alongside Sharpe, sat down, and licked his ear, making Sharpe laugh. The veteran later said that the puppy in that moment gave him a new reason for living, and that in saving Cheyenne, she’d saved him, too.

                    <p>In the spring of 2018, a local Fox affiliate in Candor, New York, reported that a Yorkshire terrier named Jazzy made the leap from rescue dog to rescuer. When Jazzy's diabetic owner fell unconscious, she tried to wake him by nudging his chin and barking frantically. This alerted the man’s mother, who was able to wake him before he went into diabetic shock. Thanks to Jazzy, her owner survived.

                    <p>Osmar Persisco of Garibaldi, Brazil, took his dog Max out for exercise in a field and was approached by two robbers who demanded his car keys. When Persisco declined, they shot him, grazing the man's head. That is when Max went into action, jumping up to attack the two men. One ran away immediately, the other shot Max twice in the chest and once in the leg before fleeing himself. Persisco rushed his protector to the vet, where Max was successfully treated for his injuries.
